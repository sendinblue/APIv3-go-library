	// agent ID. It can be found on agent’s page or received <a href=\"https://developers.sendinblue.com/docs/conversations-webhooks\">from a webhook</a>. Alternatively, you can use `agentEmail` + `agentName` + `receivedFrom` instead (all 3 fields required).
	AgentId string `json:"agentId,omitempty"`
	// mark your messages to distinguish messages created by you from the others.
	ReceivedFrom string `json:"receivedFrom,omitempty"`
	// agent email. When sending online pings from a standalone system, it’s hard to maintain a 1-to-1 relationship between the users of both systems. In this case, an agent can be specified by their email address. If there’s no agent with the specified email address in your Sendinblue organization, a dummy agent will be created automatically.
	AgentEmail string `json:"agentEmail,omitempty"`
	// agent name.
	AgentName string `json:"agentName,omitempty"`
